# cpp-oop-learning-repo
C'mon, the repo name is REALLY self-explanatory now.

I created this repository to remember some OOP in C++ because, at the present date (2021/12/21), I've been 6 months without coding a single line of code (lol).

...and the company I work for made me study C++ again (which is good, thanks.).
